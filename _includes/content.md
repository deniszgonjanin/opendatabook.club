# Open Data Book Club

## What is it?
Open Data Book Club is a monthly event where civic-minded individuals get together to talk about and present on the uses of Open Data.

Similar to a book club, each monthly event picks a theme - in this case the theme is a specific dataset or group of related datasets.

Unlike a hackathon, an Open Data Book Club does not create expectations around producing results in a short amount of time. Instead, the objective is to create a community around your local Open Data, Open Government, and Civic Tech.

## Objectives
The Open Data Book Club serves a few important purposes:

- Create sustainable local communities around Open Data.
- Direct the community’s abilities and energy around one topic at a time, creating focused discussion around a topical subset of your local Open Data.
- Allow members enough time to have discussions, form groups, and create cool things. Unlike at a hackathon, the work happens in-between Book Club meetings.
- Give the stakeholders inside local government an easy place to go to in order to find the value being created from the Open Data they are releasing.


## Format
Below are some guidelines you may want to adopt. We have found them to work for us. But feel free to play around with the format of your own Book Club. Open Data is a global movement and different communities may warrant dxifferent approaches. If you have comments or improvements you’d like to suggest, send us an email or open a Pull Request on this page’s GitHub repository.

First, create a group/mailing list. Meetup works well, and so does social media. Get the word out about what is happening, when and where.


1. Pick a Dataset to work on
If your Book Club is a local event, the first time you will probably want to pick a dataset from your local city/region.

2. Announce a time and place
Give everyone enough time to create cool stuff out of your chosen dataset. Having a book club once a month works well.

3. Have the Book Club!
Each book club is a nightly event, usually taking around 3 hours. It’s usually best held at a communal space. If you can find a local pub/restaurant with a group event space, that is perfect. The actual event usually goes like this:

- Give everyone some time to chat. 30 minutes to an hour is good. A big reason for holding the book club is to strengthen your local data community.

- Round up the presenters. Figure out who has created something for that month, and ask them to get their presentations ready.

- Give each presenter 5-10 minutes to showcase what they have done.

- At the end, pick the next months’ dataset. This is usually done via a popular vote.

## Other important bits
- Not everybody is expected to present. 2-4 presentations are usually the norm for a 20-30 person event. It is important to stress early to the community that, unlike a hackathon, there is not expectation that everybody will create something for every single book club.
- Having fun and creating conversations and a sense of community around Open Data is the most important goal.
- Please let your local government people in charge of Open Data know about the event, and do forward them links to any presentations/apps/visualizations that were created during each book club. They will want to see it, trust us.
